name: interview
description: Interview the user about an existing issue or PRD, then rewrite that file in place with richer, more concrete content (scope, acceptance criteria, goals, flows) before any plan is drafted. Use when the user wants to flesh out, clarify, or enrich an issue or PRD through a guided Q&A. Triggers on "interview me about this issue", "interview the PRD", "flesh out this issue", or "enrich this PRD".

# Interview

Conduct a focused, interactive interview about an existing **issue** or **PRD**, then
rewrite that file in place with the richer content the conversation surfaces. The user
is present — ask questions one at a time and wait for each answer. Never invent answers.

This mirrors the `epic issue interview` and `epic prd interview` CLI commands, merged
into one skill. The two targets share the same shape (read the file → find gaps → ask
focused questions one at a time → rewrite the body in place, preserving front matter)
but enrich different sections.

## Choosing the target

Decide what is being interviewed from the request and the file path:

- An **issue** — a file under `.epic/issues/` (e.g. `ISSUE-12-...md`), or the user says
  "issue". → Follow `references/issue.md`.
- A **PRD** — a file under `.epic/prds/` (e.g. `PRD-3-...md`), or the user says "PRD". →
  Follow `references/prd.md`.

If the request names a file, infer the target from its location. If it is ambiguous
which file or which type, ask the user which one to interview before starting.

## Workflow (both targets)

1. Read the target file in full, including its YAML front matter and body.
2. Identify the gaps worth asking about (the matching reference lists what to probe).
3. Ask the user **one focused question at a time** and wait for the answer. Keep
   questions concrete and answerable. Cap at roughly 5–10 questions; stop early once the
   file is clearly scoped or the user signals they are done.
4. Rewrite the file body **in place** at its existing path, following the rules in the
   matching reference.
5. Print a short confirmation summarizing what changed, then stop.

## Hard rules (both targets)

- **Preserve the YAML front matter exactly.** Only the body below the `---` block is
  yours to rewrite.
- **Keep the existing top-level heading** (`# <ID> <title>` for issues, `# PRD-N Title`
  for PRDs) unless the user explicitly asks for a rename.
- **Edit the file in place — do not create new files.**
- Preserve prior content that is still accurate; don't delete material just to fit a
  template.
- If the user declines a question or says "I don't know yet", record it (under
  `## Open Questions` for PRDs) rather than guessing.

## References

- `references/issue.md` — full prompt for interviewing an **issue** (enriches scope,
  acceptance criteria, constraints).
- `references/prd.md` — full prompt for interviewing a **PRD** (enriches goals,
  non-goals, user flows, open questions).
